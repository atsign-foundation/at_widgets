## Overview

The at_contacts_flutter package is for Flutter developers who want to add the ability to manage contacts in their atPlatform apps.

This open source package is written in Dart, supports Flutter and follows the atPlatform's decentralized, edge computing model with the following features: 
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity
- Add new contacts
- Block/unblock contacts
- Delete contacts

We call giving people control of access to their data “flipping the internet” and you can learn more about how it works by reading this [overview](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

## Get started
There are three options to get started using this package.

### 1. Quick start - generate a skeleton app with at_app
This package includes a working sample application in the [Example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/at_contacts_flutter/example) directory that you can use to create a personalized copy using ```at_app create``` in four commands.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows

### 2. Clone it from GitHub
Feel free to fork a copy the source from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets). The example code contained there is the same as the template that is used by at_app above.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets.git
```

### 3. Manually add the package to a project

Instructions on how to manually add this package to you project can be found on pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contacts_flutter/install).


## How it works

### Setup
This package needs to be initialised using:
```
initializeContactsService(rootDomain: AtEnv.rootDomain);
```

If you are using UI widgets from the package then you also have to initialise SizeConfig service.
```
SizeConfig().init(context);
```

### Usage

This package provides two UI screens:
- Contacts Screen
- Blocked Contacts Screen

The usage can be found in the example.


This package also provides useful calls:

- Get an atSign details.

```dart
TextButton(
    onPressed: () async {
        AtContact _userContact = await getAtSignDetails(_atSign);
        print(_userContact);
    },
    child: Text('Get Details'), 
),
```

- Get cached contact details

```dart
TextButton(
    onPressed: () async {
        AtContact? _userContact = await getCachedContactDetail(_atSign);
        print(_userContact ?? 'No cached contact found');
    },
    child: Text('Get Cached Details'), 
),
```
