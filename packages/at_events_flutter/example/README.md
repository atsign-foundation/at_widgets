## at_events_flutter example
The [at_events_flutter] package is designed to make it easy to manage events between atsigns.

### Give it a try
This package includes a working sample application in the [example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/at_events_flutter/example) directory that demonstrates the key features of the package. To create a personalized copy, use ```at_app create``` as shown below or check it out on GitHub.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows

## How it works

Like most applications built for the atPlatform, we start with the [at_onboarding_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter) widget which handles secure management of secret keys for an atsign as cryptographically secure replacement for usernames and passwords.

We use the [Onboarding()] widget in our [main.dart] and navigate to our [second_screen.dart] after successfully onboarding.

If you want to remove any already paired atsign, use the `Clear paired atsigns` button, it will remove all the paired atsigns for this example package.

As the [at_events_flutter] package has to be initialised, so we initialise it in the [init()] of `second_screen.dart` by calling
```dart
    initialiseEventService(NavService.navKey,
        mapKey: dotenv.get('MAP_KEY'),
        apiKey: dotenv.get('API_KEY'),
        rootDomain: 'root.atsign.org',
        streamAlternative: updateEvents
    );
```
NOTE: 
1. Make sure to pass in the [MAP_KEY] and the [API_KEY] in the `.env` file.
2. The [at_events_flutter] depends on [at_location_flutter] for location sharing, so we use the default value of [initLocation] (true) in [initialiseEventService()].

We also pass a function [updateEvents] to [initialiseEventService()] in the [streamAlternative] parameter which will give us a list of updated events from the [at_events_flutter] package.

The [second_screen.dart] consists of the following functions:
  - Create event - Will build the default create event bottomsheet. To use this functionality call [CreateEvent()].
  - Move to the map screen for an event - Call [HomeEventService().onEventModelTap()] and pass in the event parameter.
