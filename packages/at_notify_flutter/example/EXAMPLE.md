## at_notify_flutter example
The at_notify_flutter package is designed to make it easy to add notifications in atProtocol apps.

### Give it a try
This package includes a working sample application in the [example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/packages/at_notify_flutter/example) directory that demonstrates the key features of the package. To create a personalized copy, use ```at_app create``` as shown below or check it out on GitHub.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows

## How it works

Like most applications built for the atPlatform, we start with the [at_onboarding_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter) widget which handles secure management of secret keys for an atsign as cryptographically secure replacement for usernames and passwords.

We use the `Onboarding()` widget in our `main.dart` and navigate to our `second_screen.dart` after successfully onboarding.

If you want to remove any already paired atsign, use the `Clear paired atsigns` button, it will remove all the paired atsigns for this example package.

The `at_notify_flutter` package has to be initialised.
```dart
    initializeNotifyService(
      atClientManager,
      activeAtSign!,
      atClientPreference,
      rootDomain: AtEnv.rootDomain,
    );
```

The `second_screen.dart` consists of the following functions:
 - atsign - Type in the receiver atsign.
 - Enter message - Type in the message.
 - Notify Text - Send the typed in message to the atsign. If you want to use this functionality then call `notifyText()` with the required parameters.
 - Get past notifications - Navigate to a new screen, to see past notifications of the selected number of days. If you want to use this functionality then navigate to the `NotifyScreen()` screen.


To call notify
```dart
notify(
   context,
   'activeAtSign',
   'toAtSign',
   'message',
);
```
