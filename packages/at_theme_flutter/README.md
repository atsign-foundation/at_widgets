## Overview

The at_theme_flutter package is for Flutter developers who want to add ability to switch theme in their atPlatform apps.

This open source package is written in Dart, supports Flutter and follows the
atPlatform's decentralized, edge computing model with the following features: 
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity
- Ability to select and switch themes

We call giving people control of access to their data “flipping the internet” and you can learn more about how it works by reading this
[overview](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

## Get Started:

There are three options to get started using this package.

### 1. Quick start - generate a skeleton app with at_app
This package includes a working sample application in the [Example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/packages/at_theme_flutter/example) directory that you can use to create a personalized copy using ```at_app create``` in four commands.

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run ```flutter pub global activate``` once
2. Use ```at_app.bat``` for Windows


### 2. Clone it from GitHub
Feel free to fork a copy the source from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets). The example code contained there is the same as the template that is used by at_app above.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets.git
```

### 3. Manually add the package to a project

Instructions on how to manually add this package to you project can be found on pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/at_theme_flutter/install).


## How it works
This package provide a UI screen to present the theme selection, preview and apply. It also supports custom theme data.

### Setup
The theme service needs to be initialised. The root domain has to be specified.

```dart
initializeThemeService(rootDomain: AtEnv.rootDomain);
```

## Usage

### To get saved theme
```dart
AppTheme? appTheme = await getThemeData();
```

### To use custom theme
```dart
var appTheme = AppTheme.from();
var result = await setAppTheme(appTheme);
```
