## Overview

The at_invitation_flutter package is for Flutter developers who want to share
data and invite contacts using SMS or email to the @platform.


This open source package is written in Dart, supports Flutter and follows the
@‎platform's decentralized, edge computing model with the following features: 
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity
- Ability to send an invite to people not on the apps built on @‎platform

We call giving people control of access to their data “flipping the internet”
and you can learn more about how it works by reading this
[overview](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

## Get started

There are three options to get started using this package:

### 1. Quick start - generate a skeleton app with at_app

This package includes a working sample application in the
[Example](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/at_invitation_flutter/example)
directory that you can use to create a personalized copy using
`at_app create` in four commands:

```sh
$ flutter pub global activate at_app 
$ at_app create --sample=<package ID> <app name> 
$ cd <app name>
$ flutter run
```
Notes: 
1. You only need to run `flutter pub global activate` once
2. Use `at_app.bat` for Windows

### 2. Clone it from GitHub

Feel free to fork a copy of the source from the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets).
The example code contained there is the same as the template that is used by
at_app above.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets.git
```

### 3. Manually add the package to a project

Instructions on how to manually add this package to you project can be found
on pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/at_invitation_flutter/install).

## How it works

### Setup
### Initialising:

It is expected that the app will first create an AtClientService instance
and authenticate an atsign.

The invitation service needs to be initialised with the `AtClientService`
instance, current atsign, a global navigator key and a url of web page to use
for launching and redirection.

```
initializeInvitationService(
        navkey: scaffoldKey,
        atClientInstance: clientSdkService.atClientServiceInstance?.atClient,
        currentAtSign: activeAtSign,
        webPage: 'https://xxxx',
        rootDomain: MixedConstants.ROOT_DOMAIN);
```

The app also needs to handle deep links and handle incoming link with
parameters.
The [uni_links](https://pub.dev/packages/uni_links) package can be used for
this.

### Webpage requirements

A webpage with app information like store links will be required. It also
needs to have the javascript functions provided in this
[file](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets/tree/trunk/at_invitation_flutter/webpage_content/cookieManager.js).
The function `checkAndWriteCookie` needs to be called on the `onLoad` event
of the webpage.

### Caveats

- This will not work if the the user disables cookies in browser.
- In Android, Chrome browser does not support automatic redirection back to
app. User will have to tap on the link at top of the page to return to the app.
  
### Usage

### Share an invite

```
onPressed: () 
{
  shareAndInvite(context, 'welcome');
}
```

### Fetch an invite

```
fetchInviteData(context, queryParameters['key'] ?? '',
              queryParameters['atsign'] ?? '');
```
